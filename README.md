# Swift-HTTP

Building a Swift HTTP framework

This will be built while following Dave DeLong's [HTTP in Swift](https://davedelong.com/blog/2020/06/27/http-in-swift-part-1/), an 18-part series on building an HTTP framework in Swift. This project is primarily focused on personal learning, PRs may not be accepted. Raise an issue to suggest a different approach, resource or idea not discussed in the series.
